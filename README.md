# Learning Dart Basics

*I discovered why Dart is used for Flutter development. Dart is a fast, modern language that compiles to native code, making it ideal for building high-performance mobile apps.
*I also learned how to comment code effectively, using single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments to make the code more readable and maintainable. 
I became familiar with the main() function, which serves as the entry point for a Dart application, and how to use it to execute the program.

*The chapter explained how to reference different types of variables in Dart, such as numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, maps, and even runes,
allowing me to handle different types of data efficiently. I explored common flow statements, including if, for, while, and the ternary operator, 
  which help control the logic and flow of a program. The chapter also covered loops and the switch and case statements for more complex conditional logic.

*I learned how functions allow me to group reusable code, making it easier to structure and maintain my programs.
  Additionally, the import statement was introduced, showing me how to bring in external packages, libraries, or classes into my code to extend its capabilities.

*Finally, I learned how to create classes in Dart, which are essential for object-oriented programming. 
The chapter also introduced asynchronous programming, teaching me how to use async and await to prevent
